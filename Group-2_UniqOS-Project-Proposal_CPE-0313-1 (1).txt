1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
UniqOS is a simple and interactive operating system (OS) that allows academic keypersons such as teachers, administrators, and registrars to create and store student records. The OS consists of the basic functions such as reboot, shut down, version viewer, and a help desk. UniqOS also includes features such as hexadecimal to decimal converter, student record generator, grade calculator, and student card generator. Furthermore, the OS has a primary security feature which requires the user to enter a password before booting the OS.
1.2 Target Audience
UniqOS is an operating system that was mainly designed for academic keypersons. This covers teachers, administrators, and registrars. The OS is designed in a way that these people can simplify keeping a record of their students, as well as in using it to compute for the students' grades-and from there, they can generate the students' school card.
The developers aimed the system to run on the following hardware environments:

a. Desktop computer: This includes the physical components of a desktop computer, such as the CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drive, and peripherals like a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
b. Laptop: This includes the physical components of a laptop computer, such as the CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drive, and built-in peripherals like a keyboard, touchpad, and screen.
c. Server: This includes the physical components of a server, such as the CPU, RAM, hard drives, and network cards, as well as peripherals like the power supply, cooling system, and chassis.

For now, UniqOS primarily runs on a virtual manager particularly VMWare, which will be discussed later in the paper. Considering the former statement, the group considered the following system specifications and requirements based on the virtual machine used:


System Requirements

2. Project Scope
2.1 Features


List of the Available Functions

Listed below are the essential components and unique functionalities of UniqOS:

a. help- This displays the list of commands and features the OS offers.
b. version- This displays the kernel's version.
c. restart- This allow the user to reboot the OS.
d. hexdec- this function allows the user to convert a hexadecimal value to decimal.

e. studrec- This allows the user to add student information to the student record.
f. inpgrades- This function allows the user to enter the student's grades.
g. liststuds- this displays the student's information together with the averaged grade. This
enables the OS to determine whether the student passed or failed.
h. Security feature- The system requires the user to input the password before booting.

2.2 Limitations
UniqOS is a simple system that is designed for the user to understand how an operating system works-thus, it has its limitations. First, functionalities may not execute well due to memory constraints such as limited number of students can only be added to the record. Second, buffers and consoles are not added to the system; therefore, the user is unable to scroll up or down. Third, the user is unable to clear the prompt. It is only possible at reboot or shutdown. Fourth, the restart/reboot function will not cycle due to it being inside a virtual machine (i.e., stuck in debug connection). Fifth, removal is not a function because all the data is deleted at reboot. Lastly, only the system administrator can change the password.


3. High-Level Design
3.1 Architecture
Here is the overview of the architecture of UniqOS, including the major components and their interactions:
UniqOS System Architecture

The virtual machine manager, particularly VMWare, allows the user to run multiple OS'es on a single server. From the user commands as entered on the terminal, it will be passed through the kernel to access privileged functionalities until the OS.

3.2 System Requirements
As mentioned above here are the system requirement for the OS. The group mainly considered the specifications indicated in VMWare as it was used by the developers to run the OS.
A. Hardware Requirements:
a. Memory: 256MB
b. Hard Disk (IDE): 512MB
B. Software Requirements: (these programs must be pre-installed to run the OS)
a. VMWare Workstation
b. Visual Studio
c. Inno Setup
d. COSMOS User Kit

Dec. 1: The Latest Functions of the UniqOS



5. Technical Details
5.1 Programming Language
a. C#

UniqOS is built mainly by using C# for its main functions. To give an overview, C# is an object- oriented and type-safe programming language. A type-safe programming language refers to a programming language that mandates its compiler to validate data types while compiling and throw an error if a variable was assigned to the wrong type). The group chose C# because it is related to the C family of languages which the group is familiar with. Additionally, the main functions are accessed by typing "help" on the command prompt (BillWagner, 2023).
b. COSMOS

Furthermore, C# allowed the developers to construct the kernel using .NET. Specifically, the developers used COSMOS (C# Open-Source Managed Operating System) which is an operating system development kit which uses Visual Studio as its development environment (Develop Your Own OS in .NET - COSMOS, 2017).


5.2 Tools and Libraries
List any third-party tools or libraries that you plan to use and explain their relevance.

a. VMWare

The developers used VMWare in order to run the created OS, UniqOS. To give an overview, through the VMWare server, a hypervisor is installed on the physical server to allow for multiple

virtual machines to run on the same physical server. Each VM can run its own operating system. This allows multiple operating systems to run on one physical server (Bastiaansen & Lanigan, 2019).
b. COSMOS

As mentioned above, COSMOS was used to develop the kernel of UniqOS. To further delve into this development kit, it also includes an integrated project type in Visual Studio, and an integrated debugger. COSMOS also allows users to directly debug your operating system using Visual Studio by utilizing breakpoints.


6. Customization
6.1 Custom Features


Help and Version function in play


a. Security Feature

The main security feature of the OS is to require its user to enter the set password by the administrator before booting. This is a simple security feature which will be fortified in future upgrade/s.

b. Hexadecimal to decimal converter

The group also included a hexadecimal to decimal converter for its users whenever a system message (I.e., error or exception) is displayed. It helps convert hexadecimal values such as the alphabets a through f to decimal values which helps a lot in grading because there are instances that the grades used are in alphabet not numeric. Moreover, on the technical side, this will help its users and administrator to be able to identify or resolve (if they are able) system messages or issue.
c. Student Record
i. Student Record

This allows the employee to store student records such as the student's name,
number, and their course.

ii. Input of grades

The group also added a feature that allows its user to enter the grades of the student and will be able to compute for its average.
iii. List of grades and computing of average

Lastly, this feature displays the student record. Included in the list is the weighted average of the student. Furthermore, it is able to determine whether the student passed or failed based on his/her average grade.
6.2 User Interface Customization
Command Line Interface or CLI

The user interface of the OS is a command line interface (CLI). The user can enter his/her desired commands; in return, the system will acknowledge the command, access its privilege features (i.e., from the kernel), and respond to the user's request through the terminal.

7. Documentation
7.1 User Manual
Step 1. To be able to run the program, make sure to install VMWare, Visual Studio, Cosmos, and Inno Setup.
The following are the functions of each program:

a. VMWare Workstation 17 Player

VMware Workstation is a line of desktop hypervisor which lets users run virtual machines. This allows the created OS to run even if there is an existing installed OS.


VMware Workstation Interface

b. Visual Studio 2022 IDE

Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that the group used to write, edit, debug, and build code, and then deploy the OS.


Inside the Visual Studio 2022 IDE

c. Cosmos User Kit 20221121

Integrated with Visual Studio, Cosmos is an OS development or construction kit. The group was able to build an OS using C# as the main programming language.
d. Inno Setup

It provides an easy-to-use and flexible platform for software developers to package their applications into setup programs that can be easily distributed and installed on Windows operating systems.
Step 2. After installing the required software programs, launch Visual Studio. Then, open the .sln file.



UniqOS sln file

Step 3. After the file has been opened, click Run.


Inside the Visual Studio 2022 IDE

Step 4. To boot the system, enter the password (password: admin). Then press enter.


Logging in to the UniqOS

Step 5. After entering the correct password, the OS will now be boobooted,d the figure below should be displayed:


Screen after UniqOS is booted

Option 1. To open the help desk, it can be done in four ways:

a. Type "help"


"help" command

b. Type "cmd"


"cmd" command

c. Type "cmds"


"cmds" command

d. Type "commands"


"commands" command

All the available functions and features will now be displayed.


Option 2. To view the version of UniqOS, type "version"


"version" command

Option 3. To shut down the system, type "shutdown"


"shutdown" command

Option 4. To restart the system, type "restart"


Option 5. To use the hexadecimal to decimal converter, type "hexdec"


"hexdec" command

Option 6. To add students to the student record, type "studrec"


"studrec" command

Option 7. To enter the grades of the students added in the record, type "inpgrades"


"inpgrades" commands

Option 8. To display the list of students together with their averaged grades, type "liststuds"


"liststuds" command

Note: For the student to pass, the average must be greater than 75, otherwise, the student
failed.

7.2 Developer's Guide
The developers designed a simple operating system to primarily understand how it works, and how it is built and constructed. Furthermore, the developers designed the OS to be interactive. Adding a user interface, particularly CLI, the user can easily navigate the system and type in his/her commands. Lastly, UniqOS is built in a way that it can be easily modified. Moreover, it is in such a way that the developers used a familiar programming language, C#, and a very handy OS development kit, COSMOS.

8. Risks and Challenges
8.1 Identified Risks
Since UniqOS is designed to be a simple program here are its following risks:

a. Overloading of memory
The system can only store a limited number of students in its record.
b. CPU exception error
There may be times when there is sudden crashing of the program. One of its causes is when the user often runs the OS.
8.2 Mitigation Strategies
Propose strategies for mitigating the identified risks.

The developers have listed the following mitigation strategies to the identified risks:

a. Regular maintenance
Regularly maintaining the system will help avoid system crashing, fortify its security feature, and other issues that may arise.
b. Update of features
The developers must be able to rewrite concise and cohesive code structure for the features as this will help in making the system more presentable.
c. Upgrade of hardware/software specifications
To avoid memory overloading or CPU exception errors the user's handled device's
specifications must meet the requirements of the system.
d. Inclusion of buffer
This is in relation to the user interface. One of its limitations include a static prompt. The developers must resolve this issue by including buffers such as inserting a console.
9. Conclusion
The project is the venture of the group into fully understanding the beauty of operating systems. With that, through weeks of various OS lessons, the group successfully created an operating system named UniqOS. This was made in pursuit of helping academics and professions alike in their daily record-taking jobs.
One unique functionality the group boasts is the "hexdec" command. It helps convert hexadecimal values such as the alphabets a through f to decimal values that helps a lot in grading. The reason is there are instances that the grades used are in alphabet not numeric which might cause confusion.

Ultimately, there are still some improvements to be done. It is not the end of UniqOS. With rapid technological advancements and the emergence of virtual machines, UniqOS still has a lot of room to fill. With that, as computer engineers, the group is more than willing to continue development of UniqOS.
